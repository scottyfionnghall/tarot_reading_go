# Tarot Reading in Golang

Using a preexisting json file with all the tarot cards, this script reads said file, creates a custom type variable that stores name of the card, upright and reversed keywords.

There are three types of spreads:
1. Past, Present, Future
2. Situation, Obstacle, Advice
3. Mind, Body, Spirit

Based on user input, script prints out card name and it's randomly selected keywords (between upright and reversed) with a corresponding interpretation.
